# Newspaper Web App

This project was implemented with **Django** web framework using **PostgreSQL** as Database and hosted on **AWS** (Amazon Web Services).


The project's main idea was to create a newspaper website with the option to view and create articles and comments.

Users must sign in to get full access to the website, therefore they need to sign up first.

Sign up process requires a username, email address age, and password.

The User can change/reset his password by getting a transactional email.

The user can edit his posts but not others.
